                            driver operating a commercial motor vehicle on the
                            road can operate during a 70 hours within 8 days

                            continuing. Drivers are responsible for maintaining
                            a record of their hours in a logbook while operating
                            detailing hours driving and resting.

                            HOS Rules and Regulations are as follows: Note:
                            Drivers have two sets of time in one period. Drive
                            time and on duty time during the period. Drive time+
                            on duty time = total time towards the 14 hour daily
                            on duty limit. A period maxed out is 70 hours or 8
                            consecutive days, whichever comes first.

                            What this means is after 8 hours of off duty time
                            drivers need to take a 30 minute break that counts
                            against your on duty time (14 hours) then may drive
                            no more than 3 more hours within 14 hours' time. The
                            14 hours' time can't be extended by 8 hours in the
                            sleeper and 2 hours off duty time - 10 hours total.
                            Time in the sleeper (8 hours continuous) + 2 hours
                            off duty is the only way to recharge for another 14
                            hours of time on duty time. Each period while the
                            driver is on duty can't exceed whichever is soonest
                            70 hours in 8 days. To start another period the
                            driver must take 34 hours of off duty time.
