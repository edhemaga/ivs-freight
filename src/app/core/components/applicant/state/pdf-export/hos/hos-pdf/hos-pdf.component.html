        <!-- FIRST PARA-->

        <p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0; font-size: 8px; font-weight: 400">
          <span style="font-weight: 700">Hours of Service (HOS)</span> are
          regulations governed by the FMCSA which is the abbreviation for the
          “Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration”. The FM CSA is a
          division of the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT)
          which is responsible for code enforcement. “Hours of Service” refers
          to the hours that a commercial driver operating a commercial motor
          vehicle on the road can operate during a 70 hours within 8 days period
          without resting for 34 hours before continuing. Drivers are
          responsible for maintaining a record of their hours in a logbook while
          operating detailing hours driving and resting.
        </p>

        <!-- SECOND PARA -->

        <p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0; font-size: 8px; font-weight: 400">
          The basic definitions and interpretations of the new HOS Rules and
          Regulations are as follows: Note: Drivers have two sets of time in one
          period. Drive time and on duty time during the period. Drive time+ on
          duty time = total time towards the 14 hour daily on duty limit. A
          period maxed out is 70 hours or 8 consecutive days, whichever comes
          first.
        </p>

        <!-- THIRD PARA -->

        <p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0; font-size: 8px; font-weight: 400">
          Truck drivers may not drive more than 11 hours resting for 30 minutes
          before continuing after 8 hours driving.
        </p>

        <!-- FOURTH PARA -->

        <p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0; font-size: 8px; font-weight: 400">
          Truck drivers may not drive after 14 hours of on duty time.
        </p>

        <!-- FIFTH PARA -->

        <p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0; font-size: 8px; font-weight: 400">
          After 70 hours of on duty time within 8 days the driver must take 34
          hours off that include 2 - separate 8 hour sleeping shifts that have
          to include sleep during the hours of 1 am to 5 am. Yes HOS determines
          what time of the day you will sleep.
        </p>

        <!-- SIXTH PARA-->

        <p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0; font-size: 8px; font-weight: 400">
          What this means is after 8 hours of off duty time drivers need to take
          a 30 minute break that counts against your on duty time (14 hours)
          then may drive no more than 3 more hours within 14 hours’ time. The 14
          hours’ time can’t be extended by 8 hours in the sleeper and 2 hours
          off duty time - 10 hours total. Time in the sleeper (8 hours
          continuous) + 2 hours off duty is the only way to recharge for another
          14 hours of time on duty time. Each period while the driver is on duty
          can’t exceed whichever is soonest 70 hours in 8 days. To start another
          period the driver must take 34 hours of off duty time.
        </p>

          You can use the sleeper berth provision to get you on the road again
          if you have time left in your 70 hour within 8 day period but you have
          to sleep for a minimum of 8 consecutive hours and then be off duty for
          2 hours.

          After a combined total of drive time and on duty time it can’t exceed
          70 hours within 8 days’ time. As soon as you hit 70 hours or 8 days
          the driver can’t drive for 34 hours of time off.

        <p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0; font-size: 8px; font-weight: 400">
          After a driver has been on duty for his combined total of either 70
          hours within/or 8 days the period is over. You can start another
          period with 34 hours off but once again you have to get 2 different
          sleep shifts that MUST CONTAIN sleep within the hours of 1 am to 5 am
          in each sleep. Yes you ready that correctly HOS controls when you can
          sleep within 4 hours. Off means off. No paperwork, tarping, shining
          chrome. Go spend time with your family, friends or just go clear your
          head. You are important to the nation and we need you healthy so we
          can all function with whatever it is you are delivering. We love, care
          about and thank the commercial drivers of America!
