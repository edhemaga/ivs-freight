          employment history in the preceding three years, and wish to review
          previous employer-provided investigative information must submit a

          time, including when applying, or as late 30 days after being employed
          or being notified of denial of employment. The prospective employer
          must provide this information to the applicant within five (5)
          business days of receiving the written request. If the prospective
          employer has not yet received the requested information from previous
          employer(s), then the five-business day’s deadline will begin when the
          prospective employer receives the requested safety performance history

          request record within thirty (30) days of the prospective employer
          making them available, the prospective motor carrier may consider the
          driver to have waived his/her request to review the record.
