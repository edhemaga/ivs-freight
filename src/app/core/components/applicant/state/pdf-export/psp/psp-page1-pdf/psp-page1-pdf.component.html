            In connection with your application for employment with
            <span style="font-weight: 700">JD FREIGHT</span> (“Prospective
            Employer”), Prospective Employer, its employees, agents or
            contractors may obtain one or more reports regarding your driving,
            and safety inspection history from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
            Administration (FMCSA).
          </p>

          <p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0; font-size: 8px; font-weight: 400">
            When the application for employment is submitted in person, if the
            Prospective Employer uses any information it obtains from FMCSA in a
            decision to not hire you or to make any other adverse employment
            decision regarding you, the Prospective Employer will provide you
            with a copy of the report upon which its decision was based and a
            written summary of your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act
            before taking any final adverse action. If any final adverse action
            is taken against you based upon your driving history or safety
            report, the Prospective Employer will notify you that the action has
            been taken and that the action was based in part or in whole on this
            report.
          </p>

          <p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0; font-size: 8px; font-weight: 400">
            When the application for employment is submitted by mail, telephone,
            computer, or other similar means, if the Prospective Employer uses
            any information it obtains from FMCSA in a decision to not hire you
            or to make any other adverse employment decision regarding you, the
            Prospective Employer must provide you within three business days of
            taking adverse action oral, written or electronic notification: that
            adverse action has been taken based in whole or in part on
            information obtained from FMCSA; the name, address, and the toll
            free telephone number of FMCSA; that the FMCSA did not make the
            decision to take the adverse action and is unable to provide you the
            specific reasons why the adverse action was taken; and that you may,
            upon providing proper identification, request a free copy of the
            report and may dispute with the FMCSA the accuracy or completeness
            of any information or report. If you request a copy of a driver
            record from the Prospective Employer who procured the report, then,
            within 3 business days of receiving your request, together with
            proper identification, the Prospective Employer must send or provide
            to you a copy of your report and a summary of your rights under the
            Fair Credit Reporting Act.

            Neither the Prospective Employer nor the FMCSA contractor supplying
            the crash and safety information has the capability to correct any
            safety data that appears to be incorrect. You may challenge the
            accuracy of the data by submitting a request to
            https://dataqs.fmcsa.dot.gov. If you challenge crash or inspection
            information reported by a State, FMCSA cannot change or correct this
            data. Your request will be forwarded by the Data Qs system to the
            appropriate State for adjudication.

            Any crash or inspection in which you were involved will display on
            your PSP report. Since the PSP report does not report, or assign, or
            imply fault, it will include all Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV)
            crashes where you were a driver or co-driver and where those crashes
            were reported to FMCSA, regardless of fault. Similarly, all
            inspections, with or without violations, appear on the PSP report.
            State citations associated with Federal Motor Carrier Safety
            Regulations (FMCSR) violations that have been adjudicated by a court
            of law will also appear, and remain, on a PSP report.

            The Prospective Employer cannot obtain background reports from FMCSA
